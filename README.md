# Classification/Identification of vandalism
- the project uses transformer based deeplearning model [videomae](https://github.com/MCG-NJU/VideoMAE) to detect vandalism 


## TODO 
- use [supervision](https://github.com/roboflow/supervision/) to add identification of the suspect 
- make easily deployable script perhaps using [optimum](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum)
