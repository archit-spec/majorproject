# Classification/Identification of vandalism
- project model [huggingface link](https://huggingface.co/archit11/videomae-base-finetuned-fight-nofight-subset2) 
  training notebook : [here](./majorproject.ipynb)
- the project uses transformer based deeplearning model [videomae](https://github.com/MCG-NJU/VideoMAE) to detect vandalism 


## TODO 
- use [supervision](https://github.com/roboflow/supervision/) to add identification of the suspect 
- make easily deployable script perhaps using [optimum](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum)
